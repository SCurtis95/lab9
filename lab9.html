  Lab 8</h2>
  <p align="center">version 1.0</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It is recommended that you read the entire lab before you start working.</p>
  <p><strong>What you will do:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use Python to read and write the content of files</li>
    <li>Practice the use of Python dictionaries</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Task 1:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Download File Package Week9Files</li>
    <li>The two text files 2000_BoysNames.txt and 2000_GirlsNames.txt list the popularity of boys names and girls names in 2000. The format of the file is simple, one line per entry with the name followed by a space followed by the number of children carrying that name. You must write a python program that reads each text file then converts it into a csv format: "name",count then saves the entry in a csv file. The output csv file must include the following header as its first line: "First Name","Count"</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Task 2:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Write a python program that prompts the user for the name of .csv file then reads and displays each line of the file as a Python list. Test your program on the 2 csv files that you generated in Task 1.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Task 3: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Write a function generateDictionary that reads the file font3.txt and generate a dictionary where the key is the character ane the vaue is the 8*8 bit list representation of the character.</li>
    <li>Write a program that reads a character from the user and displays the associate character on the gfxHat at the coordinates of your choice. Characters not present in the dictionary are ignored and a message is displayed on the computer screen.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Task 4: Submit your lab</h3>
  <ul>
<li>Upload the files to Github and make me a colaborator. Upload to the Gihub link to Brightspace.  </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Marking Scheme</h3>

              <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Satisfactory capability, acceptable product/result</td>
              <td>7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Marginal capability, substandard product/result</td>
              <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>No capability, unacceptable product/result. Work not submitted</td>
              <td>0</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
